| Economy | Thailand |
| --- | --- |
| Economic overview: | With a relatively well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise economy, and generally pro-investment policies, Thailand is highly dependent on international trade, with exports accounting for about two thirds of GDP. Thailandâ€™s exports include electronics, agricultural commodities, automobiles and parts, and processed foods. The industry and service sectors produce about 90% of GDP. The agricultural sector, comprised mostly of small-scale farms, contributes only 10% of GDP but employs about one third of the labor force. Thailand has attracted an estimated 3.0-4.5 million migrant workers, mostly from neighboring countries. |
| Economic overview: | Over the last few decades, Thailand has reduced poverty substantially. In 2013, the Thai Government implemented a nationwide 300 baht (roughly $10) per day minimum wage policy and deployed new tax reforms designed to lower rates on middle-income earners. |
| Economic overview: | Thailandâ€™s economy is recovering from slow growth during the years since the 2014 coup. Thailandâ€™s economic fundamentals are sound, with low inflation, low unemployment, and reasonable public and external debt levels. Tourism and government spending - mostly on infrastructure and short-term stimulus measures â€“ have helped to boost the economy, and The Bank of Thailand has been supportive, with several interest rate reductions. |
| Economic overview: | Over the longer-term, household debt levels, political uncertainty, and an aging population pose risks to growth. |
