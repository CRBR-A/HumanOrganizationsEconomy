| Economy - overview: | Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole of the 20th century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. Sweden remains outside the Eurozone because of concerns over its impact on the country&rsquo;s economy, welfare system, and sovereignty. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for vast majority of industrial output. Agriculture accounts for less than 1% of GDP. Economic growth slowed in 2013, as a result of continued economic weakness in the EU - Sweden&rsquo;s main export market; however, Sweden&rsquo;s economy experienced modest growth in 2014, with an adjusted real GDP growth that averaged 2.1%. Sweden&rsquo;s economy is expected to grow modestly in 2015, although the country continues to struggle with deflationary pressure. |
