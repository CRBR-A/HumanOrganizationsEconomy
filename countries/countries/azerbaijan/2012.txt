| Economy - overview: | Azerbaijan's high economic growth during 2006-08 was attributable to large and growing oil exports, but some non-export sectors also featured double-digit growth, including construction, banking, and real estate, although most of this increase was tied to growth in the hydrocarbon sector. In 2011, economic growth slowed to 0.1%, largely because oil production reached a plateau. Real GDP growth improved in 2012, reaching about 40%, but the current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain volatile, highlighting Azerbaijan's reliance on energy exports and lackluster attempts to diversify its economy. Oil exports through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. Natural gas from fields under development in Azerbaijan by an international consortium is the only gas currently available for the geopolitically important Southern Corridor project, which aims to improve European energy security. However, Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress, including the need for stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects depend on world oil prices, the location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region, Azerbaijan's ability to negotiate export routes for its growing gas production, and its ability to manage its energy wealth to promote growth and spur employment in non-energy sectors of the economy. |
