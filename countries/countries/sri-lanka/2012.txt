| Economy - overview: | Sri Lanka continues to experience strong economic growth following the end of the 26-year conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ellam (LTTE). The government has been pursuing large-scale reconstruction and development projects supplemented with private investment in its efforts to spur growth in war-torn and disadvantaged areas, develop small and medium enterprises and increase agricultural productivity. The government's high debt payments and bloated civil service have contributed to historically high budget deficits, but economic reforms in recent years in line with IMF recommendations have helped bring down the government's fiscal deficit. The 2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments crisis. Growth slowed to 3.5% in 2009. Economic activity rebounded strongly with the end of the war and an IMF agreement, resulting in three straight years of high growth in 2010-12. Per capita income of $6,100 on a purchasing power parity basis is among the highest in the region. |
