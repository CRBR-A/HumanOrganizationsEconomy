| Economy | MALI |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | Among the 25 poorest countries in the world, Mali is a landlocked country that depends on gold mining and agricultural exports for revenue. The country's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest; cotton and gold exports make up around 80% of export earnings. Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is nomadic and about 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and fishing. Mali remains dependent on foreign aid. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. Mali is developing its iron ore extraction industry to diversify foreign exchange earnings away from gold, but the pace will largely depend on global price trends. The government is subsidizing the production of cereals to decrease the country&rsquo;s dependence on imported foodstuffs and to reduce its vulnerability to food price shocks. The main threat to Mali&rsquo;s economy is a return to physical insecurity. Other long term threats to the economy include high population growth, corruption, a weak infrastructure, and low levels of human capital. The administration&rsquo;s purchase of a presidential jet for $40 million and inflated defense contracts damaged it&rsquo;s credibility and led the IMF to temporarily suspend aid in 2014. |
