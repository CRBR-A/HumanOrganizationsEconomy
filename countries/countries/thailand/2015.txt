| Economy | THAILAND |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise economy, and generally pro-investment policies Thailand has historically had a strong economy due in part to competitive industrial and agriculture exports - mostly electronics, agricultural commodities, automobiles and parts, and processed foods. The economy experienced slow growth and declining exports in 2014, in part due to domestic political turmoil and sluggish global demand. With full employment, Thailand attracts an estimated 2-4 million migrant workers from neighboring countries, and faces labor shortages. Following the May 2014 coup d&rsquo;tat, tourism decreased 6-7% but is beginning to recover. The household debt to GDP ratio is over 80%. The Thai government in 2013 implemented a nation-wide 300 baht ($10) per day minimum wage policy and deployed new tax reforms designed to lower rates on middle-income earners. The Thai baht has remained stable. |
