| Economy | Burkina Faso |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that depends on adequate rainfall. Irregular patterns of rainfall, poor soil, and the lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure contribute to the economyâ€™s vulnerability to external shocks. About 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. |
| Economy - overview: | Cotton and gold are Burkina Fasoâ€™s key exports - gold has accounted for about three-quarters of the countryâ€™s total export revenues. Burkina Fasoâ€™s economic growth and revenue depends largely on production levels and global prices for the two commodities. The country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and exports. |
| Economy - overview: | In 2016, the government adopted a new development strategy, set forth in the 2016-2020 National Plan for Economic and Social Development, that aims to reduce poverty, build human capital, and to satisfy basic needs. A new three-year IMF program (2018-2020), approved in 2018, will allow the government to reduce the budget deficit and preserve critical spending on social services and priority public investments. |
| Economy - overview: | While the end of the political crisis has allowed Burkina Fasoâ€™s economy to resume positive growth, the countryâ€™s fragile security situation could put these gains at risk. Political insecurity in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose long-term challenges. |
