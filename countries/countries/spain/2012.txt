| Economy - overview: | After almost 15 years of above average GDP growth, the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2008. GDP contracted by 3.7% in 2009, ending a 16-year growth trend, and by another 0.3% in 2010, before expanding moderately in 2011, making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global recession. The economy, however, has once again fallen into recession as deleveraging in the private sector, fiscal consolidation, and continued high unemployment weigh on domestic demand and investment, even though exports have shown signs of resiliency. The unemployment rate rose from a low of about 8% in 2007 to roughly 25% in 2012. The economic downturn has also hurt Spain's public finances. The government budget deficit peaked at 11.2% of GDP in 2010 and the process to reduce this imbalance has been slow despite Madrid's efforts to raise new tax revenue and cut spending. Spain reduced its budget deficit to 9.4% of GDP in 2011, and roughly 6.7% of GDP in 2012, above the 6.3% target negotiated between Spain and the EU. Although Spain's large budget deficit and poor economic growth prospects remain a source of concern for foreign investors, the government's ongoing efforts to cut spending and introduce flexibility into the labor markets are intended to assuage these concerns. The government is also taking steps to shore up the banking system, namely by using up to $130 billion in EU funds to recapitalize struggling banks exposed to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate sectors. |
