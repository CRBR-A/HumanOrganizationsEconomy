| Economy - overview: | Slovakia has made significant economic reforms since its separation from the Czech Republic in 1993. After a period of relative stagnation in the early and mid 1990s, reforms to the taxation, healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems helped Slovakia consolidate its budget, get on track to join the EU in 2004, and adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly complete, the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands, and the government has facilitated a foreign investment boom with business friendly policies. Foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in the automotive and electronic sectors, fueled much of the growth until 2008. Cheap, skilled labor, low taxes, no dividend taxes, a relatively liberal labor code, and a favorable geographical location are Slovakia's main advantages to foreign investors. Growth returned, following a contraction in 2009, but has remained sluggish in large part due to continued weakness in external demand. In 2012 the government of Prime Minister Robert FICO rolled back some of Slovakia's pro-growth reforms to help shore up public finances. Corruption and slow dispute resolution remain key factors constraining economic growth. |
