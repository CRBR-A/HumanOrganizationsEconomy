| Economy | EQUATORIAL GUINEA |
| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | Exploitation of oil and gas deposits, beginning in the 1990&rsquo;s, has driven economic growth in Equatorial Guinea, allowing per capita GDP to rise to over $29,000 in 2014.  Declining revenue from hydrocarbon production, high levels of infrastructure expenditures, lack of economic diversification, and corruption have led to limited improvements in the general population&rsquo;s living conditions.  Equatorial Guinea hosted two economic diversification symposia in 2014 that focused on attracting investment in five sectors: agriculture and animal ranching, fishing, mining and petrochemicals, tourism, and financial services. Undeveloped mineral resources include gold, zinc, diamonds, columbite-tantalite, and other base metals. Forestry and farming are also minor components of GDP. Subsistence farming is the dominant form of livelihood. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy since independence has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. Foreign assistance programs by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement and high GDP figures now make Equatorial Guinea ineligible for most donor assistance. The government has been widely criticized for its lack of transparency and misuse of oil revenues and has attempted to address this issue by working towards compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.  US foreign assistance to Equatorial Guinea is limited in part because of US restrictions pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. |
