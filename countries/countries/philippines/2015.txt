| --- | --- |
| Economy - overview: | The economy has weathered global economic shocks better than its regional peers due to less exposure to troubled international securities, lower dependence on exports, relatively resilient domestic consumption, large remittances from four- to five-million overseas Filipino workers, and a rapidly expanding outsourcing industry. The current account balance has recorded consecutive surpluses since 2003, international reserves remain at comfortable levels, and the banking system is stable; the stock market resumed an upward trajectory in 2014, climbing to new record highs during the first four months of 2015. Efforts to improve tax administration and management of expenditures have helped ease the Philippines' tight fiscal situation and reduce debt levels. Nevertheless, government taxation and spending remain weak. The Philippines has received investment-grade credit ratings on its sovereign debt under the AQUINO administration and has had little difficulty financing its deficits. Economic growth has accelerated, averaging 6.0% per year from 2011-2014, compared with 4.5% under the MACAPAGAL-ARROYO government; competitiveness has improved; and foreign direct investment hit a historic high in 2014, although it continues to lag compared with the rest of the region. Unemployment has remained high, hovering at around 7% of the population, and underemployment is nearly 20%. At least 40% of the employed work in the informal sector and poverty afflicts about a quarter of the population. The AQUINO administration has been working to boost expenditures for education, health, transfers to the poor, and other social spending programs. Infrastructure remains underfunded and the government is relying on the private sector to help with major projects under its Public-Private Partnership program. Other long term challenges include reforming governance, the judicial system, and the regulatory environment, and improving the ease of doing business. The Philippine Constitution and other laws restrict foreign ownership in important activities/sectors - such as land ownership and public utilities. Some progress has been made in establishing a Customs Modernization Act to meet international standards and commitments. |
